<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm a 25-year-old woman living a bit of a double life currently. By day, 
   I'm working as a stewardess in the hustle and bustle of the airport, but by night,
   I'm knee-deep in the fascinating world of programming. Front-end development has become my current passion, 
   but I'm always up for learning new things and broadening my horizons in the coding universe. I really enjoy new challenges.
   They're not scary for me! In fact, they're like my personal fuel, pushing me to learn and grow.
  
<p>Lately, I've been realizing just how introverted my nature is.
   While the airport environment is dynamic, the quiet focus required in coding resonates more with me. 
   The prospect of diving into a coding job where I can immerse myself in the intricacies of a project and let my creativity flow is incredibly appealing. 
   It's not just about the code; it's about finding a professional path that aligns with my inner self and allows me to thrive.</p>

<p>Beyond the coding adventures, my daily routine is a mix of things I love. 
  Cooking is more than just a chore â€“ it's a creative outlet where I can whip up all sorts of tasty experiments. 
  The gym is my happy place, where I get my dose of endorphins and keep the energy flowing. 
  And when it's time to unwind, you'll catch me diving into books, whether it's about personal development or the spiritual side of life.
   These interests keep my life vibrant, shaping who I am and where I want to go. 
   The idea of transitioning into a coding career isn't just about a job change; it's about aligning my professional life with my true self, and that's where I see my journey heading.</p>
